## 💬 Introduction

**Chinese document: [README.md](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv/blob/main/README.md)**

- This is a magical project that achieves batch image generation, which NovelAI itself cannot accomplish!
  
- It not only generates images but also integrates various practical functions into one super user interface!

- **If you encounter any issues during usage, please join the QQ group for consultation: [632344043](https://qm.qq.com/cgi-bin/qm/qr?k=8kjjU-FPNACadpEJqD8KswH9l99XDQ_I&jump_from=webapi&authKey=co29EPnkueC2/+QHQ7CVJNJR1d6Cp+eF6JFpvMdHsYas0jtSkwVcKiIxm+vMvMV1)**

> [!TIP]
> On that day, heavy rain poured, thunder roared, and the wind was noisy, as if the whole world was trembling for some unknown force.

| Text-to-Image | A user interface for NovelAI using Gradio, functionally identical to using the NovelAI website except for the interface | ![image](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv/blob/main/files/imgs/1.png?raw=true) | Generated images will be saved to the `./output/t2i` folder |
| Random NSFW Image | Generates a NSFW image randomly using tags from `./files/favorite.json`, negative prompt words will be randomly chosen from the negative beliefs in favorite.json | ![image](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv/blob/main/files/imgs/3.png?raw=true) | For configuration of random NSFW images, please refer to the other parts of the WebUI configuration settings page |
| Random Image | Infinitely generates images using prompts from `*.txt` files in `./file/prompt` appended with user input, negative prompt words will be randomly chosen from the negative beliefs in favorite.json | ![image](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv/blob/main/files/imgs/4.png?raw=true) | For configuration of random images, please refer to the other parts of the WebUI configuration settings page |
| Vibe | Functionally identical to using NovelAI website, added batch functionality | ![image](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv/blob/main/files/imgs/16.png?raw=true) | Prepare some images in the same folder, rename images to `(any(not containing underscores))_(information extraction strength, float(0, 1))_(reference strength, float(0, 1)).png)` format, e.g., `hoshino-hinata_1.0_0.6`, when selecting random NSFW, infinite generation will follow random NSFW mode, otherwise, infinite generation will follow random image mode |
| Image-to-Image | Functionally identical to using NovelAI website, supports any image, added batch processing | ![image](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv/blob/main/files/imgs/2.png?raw=true) | Generated images will be saved to the `./output/i2i` folder, a temporary image named `temp.png` will be generated in the `./output` folder, can be deleted, for batch processing, place images in the same folder, e.g., `./output/choose_to_i2i` |
| Partial Redraw | Supports images generated by NovelAI, requires uploading a mask, supports batch operations | ![image](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv/blob/main/files/imgs/5.png?raw=true) | Uploaded mask should have redrawn areas in white, remaining areas transparent (not black), resolution should match the redrawn image, for batch operations, place images and masks in two separate folders with identical filenames, e.g., `./output/inpaint/img`, `./output/inpaint/mask`, generated images will be saved to `./output/inpaint` |
| Video-to-Illustration | Redraw the video in several steps to convert 3D into 2D | ![image](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv/blob/main/files/imgs/18.png?raw=true) | Experimental feature, suggestions are welcome |
| Chunk redraw | Split a large image into 640x640 chunks, and then enlarge these chunks to 1024x1024 in the way of a diagram, I don't need to worry about the two images being too connected, I use the open source project in the credits list to fix the seams [rife-ncnn-vulkan](https://github.com/nihui/rife-ncnn-vulkan) | ![image](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv/blob/main/files/imgs/19.png?raw=true) | Due to the long time required, only a single zoom is currently available, and you need to provide a picture or image path (choose one) | when you use it
| Super Resolution Denoising | Utilizes open-source projects listed in the acknowledgments to perform super resolution denoising on images, supports single or batch processing | ![image](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv/blob/main/files/imgs/6.png?raw=true) | Generated images will be saved to the `./output/upscale` folder, not recommended to use **srmd-cuda** due to instability, when using **waifu2x-caffe** or **waifu2x-converter**, a temporary batch file named `temp.bat` will be generated in the `./output` folder, can be deleted, for batch processing, place images in the same folder, e.g., `./output/choose_to_upscale` |
| Auto Mosaic | Automatically detects key parts in images and mosaic them | ![image](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv/blob/main/files/imgs/7.png?raw=true) | Cannot guarantee 100% detection, generated images will be saved to the `./output/mosaic` folder, for batch processing, place images in the same folder, e.g., `./output/choose_to_mosaic` |
| Add Watermark | Adds a specified number of random watermarks with random transparency at random positions (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) on images | ![image](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv/blob/main/files/imgs/8.png?raw=true) | Prepare your watermarks in `./files/water` folder before usage. Enter the directory of images to be processed and click OK, processed images will be saved to the `./output/water` folder |
| Upload to Pixiv | Batch uploads images to Pixiv | ![image](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv/blob/main/files/imgs/9.png?raw=true) | For Pixiv upload configuration, please refer to other parts of the WebUI configuration settings page |
| Image Filtering | Tool for manually filtering images | ![image](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv/blob/main/files/imgs/10.png?raw=true) | Enter the image directory and press OK, then input the output directory. A file named `array_data.npy` will be generated in the `./output` folder, it saves the progress of the last filtering, so you can continue without selecting the image directory again, after filtering, it will be automatically deleted |
| Data Erasure | Batch erases, restores, or exports image generation information | ![image](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv/blob/main/files/imgs/11.png?raw=true) | For restoration, prepare at least a *.png image with prompt or a *.txt file containing prompt, and place it in a directory (image information file directory), the filenames (without extension) in the selected directory to be restored need to be consistent with those in the image information file directory |
| Magic Analysis | Reads png info using open-source projects listed in the acknowledgments | ![image](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv/blob/main/files/imgs/12.png?raw=true) | Embedded into this project via iframe |
| Tagger | Utilizing the reverse inference model deployed on Hugging Face by [SmilingWolf](https://huggingface.co/spaces/SmilingWolf/wd-tagger), I added batch operations to it | ![image](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv/blob/main/files/imgs/17.png?raw=true) | During batch processing, the generated prompt text will be saved to the same directory as the images |
| GPT Free | Free, multi-model GPT, utilizing open-source projects listed in the acknowledgments | ![image](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv/blob/main/files/imgs/13.png?raw=true) | Embedded into this project via iframe |

## 🌟 Usage

- **Run `run.bat`, it will automatically open the default browser and navigate to [127.0.0.1:11451](http://127.0.0.1:11451)**

- For old version users: It's no longer recommended to run individual scripts. Please use the WebUI.

- If it's really necessary (for example, if the browser has added the sleep whitelist but cannot continue generating on an inactive page), please configure the directory and other parameters in the WebUI and click **Generate Standalone Scripts** (you can also read the source code to write standalone scripts by yourself), then run **run_stand_alone_scripts.bat** in the root directory.

- For plugin development, please refer to: [Wiki](https://github.com/zhulinyv/Semi-Auto-NovelAI-to-Pixiv/wiki/%E6%8F%92%E4%BB%B6%E5%BC%80%E5%8F%91)
